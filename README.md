# Damn Small/Simple Time Tracker

dstt stores file .dsst.json on folder, you can just store it in git or add to .gitignore

1 day = 8 hours and 1 week = 5 days, you can change it in dstt.py:working_intervals


Usage: 
* `dstt start` to start timer on current folder
* `dstt stop` to stop timer
* `dstt show` to see, how many hours you've worked


## TODO:
* `add` to add some time without log
* remove fire dependency
* multiuser sync
